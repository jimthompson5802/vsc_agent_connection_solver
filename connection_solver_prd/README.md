# Product requirements documents for the connection solver.

This directory contains the product requirements documents (PRDs) for the connection solver. 
The PRDs outline the features, functionality, and design of the connection solver. They are intended to provide a clear understanding of the requirements and expectations for the development team.

With the exception of `setup_prd.md`, which was manually created, all other PRDs were created by reverse engineering the existing [Agentic Virtual Agent (AVA) codebase](https://github.com/jimthompson5802/connection_solver).

The workspace was set up with only these contents:
- `.github/` contains `copilot-instructions.md` to instruct GitHub Copilot with coding conventions used in this project.
- `.vscode/` contains `launch.json` for running and debugging the code in VSCode.
- `puzzle_data/` contains the puzzle data files.
- `.env` symbolic link to enviornment variables required for LLM access.

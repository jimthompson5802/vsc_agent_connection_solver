| TOOL001         | As a user, I want to provide a list of words from a file so that I can use them for solving puzzles.             | - The system should read the first line of a file and extract words separated by commas. <br> - If the file is not found, the system should notify the user. <br> - The extracted words should be returned as a list. |
| TOOL002         | As a user, I want to extract words from an image so that I can use them for solving puzzles.                     | - The system should encode the image in base64 format. <br> - The system should send the encoded image to an LLM for word extraction. <br> - The extracted words should be returned in lowercase.                   |
| TOOL003         | As a user, I want to choose the source of puzzle words so that I can set up a puzzle manually.                   | - The system should prompt the user to select between a file or an image as the source. <br> - Based on the selection, the system should extract words using the appropriate method.                                 |
| TOOL004         | As a user, I want to receive recommendations for word groups and provide feedback on them.                      | - The system should display a recommendation message with the suggested words and their connection. <br> - The system should prompt the user for feedback using specific response options (e.g., y/g/b/p/m/s/o/n). |
| TOOL005         | As a user, I want to check if a generated word group matches any solution so that I can validate the recommendation. | - The system should compare the generated word group with the provided solutions. <br> - If the groups match exactly, the system should return "correct". <br> - If three words overlap, the system should return "o". <br> - Otherwise, the system should return "n". |

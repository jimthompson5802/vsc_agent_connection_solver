| OPENAI001         | As a user, I want to generate vocabulary for a list of words so that I can understand their meanings. | The system should asynchronously process each word and return a JSON object with parts of speech and examples. |
| OPENAI001.001        | As a user, I want to generate a vocabulary for a list of words.            | The system should accept a list of words as input and return a dictionary where the keys are the input words and the values are structured vocabulary results in JSON format.                                                            |
| OPENAI001.002        | As a user, I want the vocabulary to include diverse definitions.           | The system should generate multiple definitions for each word, categorized by parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). Each definition should be prefixed with the part of speech.                                                 |
| OPENAI001.003        | As a user, I want the vocabulary to be generated asynchronously.           | The system should process each word asynchronously using a language model and return the results once all words are processed.                                                                                                          |
| OPENAI001.004        | As a user, I want the vocabulary results to follow a specific JSON format. | The system should return the vocabulary results as a JSON object with a "result" key containing a list of strings, where each string is formatted as "part of speech: example".                                                          |
| OPENAI001.005        | As a user, I want the system to handle multiple words at once.             | The system should use `asyncio.gather` to process multiple words concurrently and ensure that the final output includes vocabulary results for all input words.                                                                          |
| OPENAI002         | As a user, I want to generate embeddings for definitions so that I can analyze their relationships. | The system should return a list of embeddings for the provided definitions.                             |
| OPENAI002.001         | As a user, I want to generate embeddings for a list of definitions.        | The system should take a list of strings as input and return a list of embeddings, where each embedding is a list of floats.                                                                                                            |
| OPENAI002.002         | As a user, I want to analyze and choose a unique group of words.           | The system should asynchronously process a string of candidate word groups, analyze their themes, and return a JSON response with: <br> - A key `candidategroup` containing the most unique group of 4 words. <br> - A key `explanation`. |
| OPENAI003         | As a user, I want to identify a unique group of words from candidates so that I can solve puzzles. | The system should analyze word groups and return a JSON object with the most unique group and explanation. |
| OPENAI003.001         | As a user, I want the system to analyze a list of words and suggest groups | The system should use an LLM to identify groups of four words that share a common theme. The output must be in JSON format with keys "words" (list of grouped words) and "connection" (description of the connection).                   |
| OPENAI003.002         | As a user, I want the system to avoid invalid word groups                  | The system must ensure that no invalid groups are included in the output. Each word should belong to only one group, and the groups must be ordered by confidence level.                                                                |
| OPENAI003.003         | As a user, I want the system to provide clear and logical connections      | The system should focus on accurate thematic grouping and handle edge cases where a word could fit into multiple categories. The JSON output must clearly describe the connection among the grouped words.                              |
| OPENAI003.004         | As a user, I want the system to log its operations for debugging purposes  | The system should log entry and exit points of the function, as well as debug information such as the remaining words and the response from the LLM.                                                                                    |
| OPENAI004         | As a user, I want to extract words from an image so that I can use them in my analysis. | The system should process a base64-encoded image and return a JSON object with a list of extracted words. |
| OPENAI005         | As a user, I want to analyze a group of anchor words to determine their connection. | The system should return a JSON object with a "single" or "multiple" response and an explanation.        |
| OPENAI006         | As a user, I want to find the most connected word to a group of anchor words so that I can make informed decisions. | The system should return a JSON object with the most connected word and the reason for its selection.    |
| OPENAI007         | As a user, I want to determine the next step in a workflow based on the current state. | The system should return a JSON object with the next tool to use based on the workflow state and instructions. |

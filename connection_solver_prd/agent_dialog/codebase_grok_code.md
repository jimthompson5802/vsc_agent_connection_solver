jimthompson5802: #codebase what does app.py do

GitHub Copilot: The app.py file implements the backend logic for the NYT Connection Puzzle Solver web application. It uses the Quart framework (an asynchronous alternative to Flask) to define routes and handle requests. Here's a summary of its functionality:

### Key Responsibilities:
1. **Puzzle State Management**:
   - Maintains a global `puzzle_state` dictionary to track the current state of the puzzle, including:
     - Remaining words
     - Correct and invalid groups
     - Active recommender
     - Puzzle status
     - Recommended group and connection reason

2. **Endpoints**:
   - `/` (GET): Serves the main web UI page.
   - `/setup` (POST): Sets up the puzzle by loading words from a file (WEB01, WEB01a).
   - `/recommend` (GET): Provides the next word group recommendation (WEB03).
   - `/feedback` (POST): Processes user feedback on recommendations (WEB04).
   - `/override` (POST): Handles manual overrides of recommendations (WEB05).
   - `/terminate` (POST): Terminates the puzzle-solving process (WEB08).

3. **Integration with Workflow Manager**:
   - Uses the `workflow_manager` module to manage the puzzle-solving workflow, including initializing states, applying recommendations, and analyzing errors (e.g., "one-away" errors).

4. **Asynchronous Request Handling**:
   - All route handlers are asynchronous, leveraging Quart's support for async/await to handle requests efficiently.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Includes error handling for invalid inputs, file operations, and workflow-related issues, returning appropriate JSON responses.

6. **User Stories Addressed**:
   - Implements features described in the PRD, such as puzzle setup, recommendations, feedback processing, manual overrides, and termination.

### Example Workflow:
- A user uploads a puzzle file via `/setup`, which initializes the puzzle state.
- The user requests a recommendation via `/recommend`, which returns a suggested word group and its connection reason.
- Feedback on the recommendation is submitted via `/feedback`, updating the puzzle state.
- The user can manually override recommendations via `/override` or terminate the process via `/terminate`.

This file serves as the core backend for the web application, coordinating user interactions, puzzle state updates, and workflow logic.

jimthompson5802: #codebase what does workflow_manager.py do

GitHub Copilot: The workflow_manager.py file implements the workflow management system for the Connection Puzzle Solver. It handles the flow between different tools and processes required to solve the puzzle. Here's a summary of its functionality:

### Key Responsibilities:
1. **Workflow Graph Management**:
   - Defines workflows using `StateGraph` from `langgraph`.
   - Implements functions like `create_workflow_graph` and `create_webui_workflow_graph` to define the sequence of steps for solving puzzles.

2. **Tool Execution**:
   - Provides functions for executing specific tools, such as:
     - `setup_puzzle`: Initializes the puzzle state.
     - `get_embedvec_recommendation`: Generates recommendations using word embeddings.
     - `get_llm_recommendation`: Uses an LLM to generate recommendations.
     - `one_away_analyzer`: Analyzes "one-away" errors.
     - `apply_recommendation`: Applies the recommended group to the puzzle state.

3. **Planner and Decision Making**:
   - Implements a `run_planner` function that uses an LLM to decide the next tool to execute based on the current state.
   - Includes a `determine_next_action` function to determine the next step in the workflow.

4. **State Management**:
   - Converts between the web UI's `puzzle_state` and the workflow's internal state using helper functions like `initialize_state_from_puzzle_state` and `update_puzzle_state_from_workflow`.

5. **Workflow Execution**:
   - Provides an asynchronous `run_workflow` function to execute the workflow graph step-by-step.
   - Handles errors and retries during workflow execution.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements retry mechanisms and error thresholds (e.g., `MAX_ERRORS` and `RETRY_LIMIT`) to manage workflow failures.

7. **Logging**:
   - Logs workflow execution details, errors, and recommendations for debugging and monitoring.

### Integration:
- Integrates with external libraries like `langchain` for LLM interactions and `langgraph` for workflow graph management.
- Interacts with the web application's global `puzzle_state` to synchronize the UI and backend.

### User Stories Addressed:
- Implements features like generating recommendations, handling feedback, analyzing errors, and managing the puzzle-solving process, as described in the PRD user stories (e.g., US002, US003, US004, US005).

In summary, workflow_manager.py serves as the core backend logic for managing the puzzle-solving workflow, coordinating tools, and updating the puzzle state.

# setup environment

jimthompson5802: setup the environment as described in the attachment user stories.  as you perform the setups, cite the user story id.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you set up the environment as described in the user stories. Let's work through this step by step.

## Setting up the Project Environment

First, let's check the current structure of the workspace to make sure we're working in the right location.I can see the workspace structure with the connection_solver_prd and puzzle_data folders. Let's proceed with setting up the environment according to the user stories.

### SETUP00: Setting up a Virtual Environment

I'll create a Python virtual environment using Python 3.11 as specified in your instructions.I've created a Python 3.11 virtual environment as specified in SETUP00. The command completed successfully without any errors.

Now, let's activate the virtual environment and create a requirements.txt file with all the necessary dependencies mentioned in the user stories.The virtual environment has been successfully created and activated. Now, let's create the requirements.txt file with all the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the user stories.

### Creating requirements.txt (SETUP00, SETUP01, SETUP02, SETUP03)

Let's create a requirements.txt file with all the necessary packages:
````
quart
openai
langchain
langchain-openai
langgraph
pytest
black
````


Made changes.

Now I'll continue setting up the environment according to the user stories.

### Installing Dependencies (SETUP00, SETUP01, SETUP02, SETUP03)

Let's install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:Great! All the dependencies have been successfully installed. Let's continue with the remaining tasks from the user stories.

### SETUP04: Setting up version control with Git

Let's initialize a git repository and create an appropriate .gitignore file:Now I'll create a .gitignore file for a Python project on macOS:
````

Made changes.

Let's now create a README.md file to document the project setup as mentioned in multiple user stories (SETUP00, SETUP01, SETUP02, and SETUP03):
````
# NYT Connection Puzzle Solver

An agentic virtual assistant to help solve the New York Times Connection Puzzle.

## Project Setup

### Virtual Environment (SETUP00)

This project uses a Python 3.11 virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

The project relies on the following key packages:

- **Quart** (SETUP01): A Python ASGI web framework with a Flask-like API
- **OpenAI** (SETUP02): Client library for the OpenAI API
- **LangChain & LangGraph** (SETUP02): Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **Pytest** (SETUP03): Testing framework for Python
- **Black**: Code formatter for Python

All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Development

### Code Style

This project follows the Black code style. Format your code with:

```bash
black .
```

### Running Tests

Tests can be run using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

### Running the Web Application

The web application is built using Quart (an ASGI web framework). More details on how to run the application will be provided as development progresses.

## Environment Setup Complete

I've successfully completed setting up the environment as described in the user stories. Here's a summary of what's been done:

### SETUP00: Virtual Environment
- Created a Python 3.11 virtual environment using `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -m venv venv`
- Activated the virtual environment 
- Created and populated a requirements.txt file
- Documented the virtual environment setup in the README

### SETUP01 & SETUP02: Required Packages
- Installed Quart web framework
- Installed OpenAI, LangChain with OpenAI support, and LangGraph
- All package installations completed successfully
- Documented these dependencies in the README

### SETUP03: Testing Framework
- Installed pytest for testing
- Documented the testing setup in the README

### SETUP04: Version Control
- Initialized a Git repository with "main" as the default branch
- Created a comprehensive .gitignore file for a Python project on macOS
- The Git initialization was successful with the message: "Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/jim/Desktop/genai/vsc_agent_connection_solver/.git/"

The environment is now fully set up according to the specified user stories. The README provides documentation on how to activate the environment, install dependencies, format code with Black, and run tests with pytest.

To start developing the application, you can now activate the virtual environment and begin implementing the features described in the other PRD documents.
